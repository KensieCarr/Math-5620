## Problem 1
**Routine Name:**           Norm of a Matrix

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 

This routine will provide an approximate solution of the Laplace equation
{% raw %}
\\( \Delta u = \sin (x y) \\)
{% endraw %}
on the unit square in two dimensions. It will compute the mesh using a 9 point stencil, initialize the matrix and right hand sides, then solve the linear system using an appropriate LU factorization.

**Input:**

A = matrix that is m by n

**Output:** 

1-norm

âˆž-norm

**Usage/Example:**


**Implementation/Code:**
