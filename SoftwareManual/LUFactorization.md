## Problem 5
**Routine Name:**           Tridiagonal Coefficient Matrix

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 

This routine will solve a linear system of equations with tridiagonal coefficient matrix using an LU factorization. It will also determine the relationship betwen the size of the matrices as n varies and the time is takes to compute the solution.


**Input:**

A = tridiagonal matrix

b = vector

**Output:** 

x = vector

r = Relationship between the size of the matrices as n varies and the time it takes to compute the solution.

**Usage/Example:**


**Implementation/Code:**
