## Problem 6
**Routine Name:**           Logistic Differential Equation

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 
This routine will compute the analytic solution of the following logistic differenial equation. dP/dt = alpha * P - beta P^2 for the parameters, alpha and beta, and initial condition P(0) = P_0 and give us a solution at time t
**Input:** 
P_0 = P(0) initial condition
a = scalar alpha
b = scalar beta

**Output:** 
t = value of the solution at an arbitrary point

**Usage/Example:**
Say I adopt a population of dogs P(t) satisfying the logistic equation dP/dt = aP - bP^2. I take 120 of them to an island and leave them there. There are 8 births per month and 6 deaths per month at time t = 0. How many months does it take for P(t) to reach 95% of the limiting population M?
![Example Logistic](https://KensieCarr.github.io/Math-5620/Solution Manual/LogisticEquation.JPG)
It takes 27.69 months.
