## Problem 2

**Routine Name:**           Find Machine Epsilon

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** This routine will compute the single precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of digits
in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing the behavior of any computer. This
usually will need to be run one time for each computer.

**Input:** There are no inputs needed in this case. Even though there are arguments supplied, the real purpose is to
return values in those variables.

**Output:** This routine returns a single precision value for the number of decimal digits that can be represented on the
computer being queried.

**Usage/Example:**


**Implementation/Code:**
